# Geocenter
Geocenter is a desktop application that allows you to easily create, edit, and manage your own media library. It is built on top of the [Tuari](https://tauri.app/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/).

Most media library managers are either too complicated, or too simple. I wanted to create something that was simple to use, but also had the features I wanted.

This will eventually be a full-featured media library manager, but for now it is just a proof of concept.
